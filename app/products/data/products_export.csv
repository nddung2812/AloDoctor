Their bright red color really adds beauty to a tank, especially one loaded with live green aquarium plants and black gravel or substrate. Cherry Shrimp or Neocaridina heteropoda, also known simply as Cherry Shrimp, are natives of Taiwan. But most available in stores today are bread in captivity as they can reproduce in fresh water.

echinodorus-quadricostatus,Echinodorus quadricostatus,"<p> </p>
<p> The genus-name Echinodorus comes from Greek 'echino' (bristle, prickle) and 'doros' (gift) and refers to the hedgehog-like seeds, the species-name quadricostatus means 'with four ribs' and refers to the seeds.</p>
<p> Portion: 3-5 plants per bunch</p>
<p>Synonyms: Echinodorus magdalensis, Echinodorus intermedius.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Family Alismataceae</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Common Name: chain sword</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Location: Central and South America</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Echinodorus quadricostatus is a little plant that is appropriate for smaller tanks or as a foreground plant in bigger ones. The plant is 10-15 cm (4-6”) tall. It has 1-2 cm (.39-.78”) wide bright green leaves. The leaves are narrow lancet-shaped. This plant has characteristic light-green leaves which form a good contrast to the darker aquarium plants. It is most beautiful when planted in groups. In good conditions it produces runners which spread over the bottom. Growth is more compact when planted in a pot or between stones or other objects. Very light leaves are a sign of a shortage of micro-nutrients. There is some confusion about the name of this plant, and it has been sold as Echinodorus bolivianus var. magdalenensis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plant can be very prolific in proper conditions and will grow in all types of water</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The species is known in three variants: var. quadricostatus, var. magdalensis and var. xinguensis (narrow leaf form). These are separated only by differences in the form of the leaves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Light requirements: medium-very high</p>
<p> Echinodorus quadricostatus</p>
<p>Temperature: 20-28 °C (68-82°F)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hardness tolerance: very soft-hard</p>
<p> </p>
<p>pH tolerance: 6-9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Growth: fast</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Propagation: Very prolific. Sends out runners.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>I got this plant for my upstairs 70 gallon display tank. This tank is a Fluval Osaka 260 tank. This is the tank with the rounded glass corners on the tank. This tank comes with 36"" T5 high output double fluorescent fixtures with 2 bulbs. The tank is filtered with a Fluval 405. There are many different plants in this set up. I was able to try some plants I normally stay away from since this tank has better lighting on it than I normally have over my planted tanks. I did have an algae bloom problem for several months after setting the tank up. This was the type of algae that floats through the water. I just slowly kept adding plants and eventually this bloom disappeared. This plant didn’t do much at the beginning when I got it. It put out 3 little plants and stopped there. It stayed like that for over 3 months. Then one day while doing a water change I noticed something different about the quadricostatus plant. One of the little plants that the original plant had put out was growing like mad. It put out a really decent runner with lots of daughter plants on it. This runner made it out of the ground and kept growing daughter plants all the way up to the surface of the tank. I would think that there is at least 12 plants on that one runner. The catfish in the tank (farlowellas – 2 different species), have left this plant alone. The dwarf cichlids (Apistogramma borellii and Mikrogeophagus altispinosa) like to swim through the leaves but otherwise ignore the plants. I don’t add any fertilizers to my water. They get whatever comes from feeding the fish.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The tank gets monthly water changes since it is lightly stocked. The Fluval gets cleaned out properly every 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the part of the tank that this plant is in, it’s created a little thicket of Echinodorus quadricostatus plants. I think if you let it, this interesting little plant could make a carpet in the foreground of your tank. I will be offering up this plant shortly to interested parties.</p>

cryptocoryne-spiralis-tiger,Cryptocoryne spiralis 'Tiger,"<p> </p>
<p>With 'Tiger' and 'Red', two pretty new forms of Cryptocoryne spiralis have entered the market via ADA few years ago. They are still rarely available in Europe. The Spiral water trumpet from southwestern India is an extremely polymorphic species, however the form 'Tiger' is unique. It resembles Cryptocoryne albida ""Brown"" but gets larger and grows faster. Its submerged leaves are very narrowly lanceolate with smooth to wavy edge, brown-red with dark ""tiger stripes"" that are more pronounced than in Cryptocoryne spiralis 'Red'. It also differs from the latter by wider, shorter, more spreading leaves under same growth conditions. Sometimes the midrib is vividly green, but less often than in 'Red'. In our aquariums, the 'Tiger' has formed nearly 30 cm long, 1,3 cm wide leaves but may become considerably taller.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As several other Cryptocoryne spiralis forms, 'Tiger' is apparently a quite easy aquarium plant. Nutrient-rich substrate and CO2 addition are very beneficial for its growth. It is not a low-light plant, the lighting should be at least moderate, and strong light enhances its showy coloration. With time, daughter rosettes appear at the base of the plant that develops a tuft with many leaves and strong roots. The daughter plants can be cut off for propagation. We have not yet noticed long runners in C. spiralis 'Tiger'.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cryptocoryne spiralis 'Tiger' is an eye-catcher in not too small aquariums, best as a solitary bush in the midground. Its red-brown tones contrast well with light green plants</p>",Duckaroo,Home & Garden,Product_Plants,"",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,,,"",0.0,shopify,deny,manual,149.00,,true,true,,,,,,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0587/7422/5058/files/tieu-thao-tiger.jpg?v=1701513125,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kg,,50.00,active

anubias-chili-submerged-limited-stock,Anubias Chili - Submerged/Limited stock,"<p>Common Name: Anubias Chili </p>
<p>***<strong> Priced per one cutting: Around 5-6 leaves.</strong></p>
<p>Anubias Chili is an extremely rare variant in the Anubias family that is highly sought after due to its small leaves. Smaller than the more commonly known, Anubias Nana Petite, Anubias Chili resembles Anubias Pangolino, another rare variant of Anubias. Anubias Chili has very small leaves that resemble small chili peppers and is very easy to care for in a planted aquarium. Like all Anubias plants, Anubias Chili is also very slow growing and does not require too much care to do well in a planted tank. </p>
<p>Like other Anubias, this variant is a flowering plant that grows best when the rhizome is attached to a hard surface such as aquarium wood or stones. Anubias species have low to medium light requirements and can benefit from regular fertilization along with CO2 injection. While CO2 is not necessary, it can promote faster growth and more robust leaves. Since Anubias are slow growers, the leaves are susceptible to algae growth if placed under lighting that is too strong.  </p>
<p>Propagation is easy and straightforward; simply cut or pull apart rhizomes to be replanted. <span>Make sure to keep the rhizomes above your substrate or the plant has the potential to rot.  </span></p>
<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Anubias are strong plants that can thrive in a variety of environments.</span></li>
<li>
<span>These epiphytes can be planted above the substrate or attached to hardscape</span>.</li>
<li>Burying the rhizome, will cause the plant to melt and die.</li>
<li><span>Do not make drastic changes to the aquarium. Unstable parameters will result in melt and rotting of the aquarium plant.</span></li>
<li><span>CO2 injection and quality aquarium soil will yield better growth.</span></li>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Rotala ramosior Florida is an attractive stem plant with small deep purple leaves and a green stem. The plant was collected from Florida, USA as its name suggests. It is demanding in terms of light and CO2 and is not suitable for low tech/non CO2 injected tanks. It is not yet widely cultivated by large scale commercial aquatic plant farms, but can be found readily among hobbyist aquatic plant collectors.</p>

The name Rotala indica has been known in the aquarium hobby for a long time, but it was erroneously used for the totally different species Rotala rotundifolia. The unique appearance of Rotala indica can best be described as compact miniature version of Bacopa caroliniana. R. indica is a slow grower; under a lot of light, the shoot tips and stems turn reddish. With its straight hardly ramified thick stems and its roundish leaves it is best planted in a group in the fore- or middle ground of a tank.

This fresh, exciting coloration makes the Albino Blue Topaz stand out and is relished by guppy enthusiasts and any freshwater aquarium hobbyist interested in unusual and distinct fish.</span></div>
<div class=""quick_stat_entry"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The guppy (<em data-mce-fragment=""1"">poecilia reticulata) </em>is one of the most beautiful and easy to keep fish of all times.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">A great tropical fish for freshwater aquarium fish beginners, the Guppy is a very hardy tropical fish that is also a very prolific breeder. The male guppy is easy to distinguish from the female guppy because the male is usually more colorful with extremely colorful and large caudal fins (tails). The female is usually larger, thicker bodied, with less color and a smaller cuadal fin (tail).</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">They are livebearers which means that the babies are free swimming at birth. At each birth, the female can have anywhere between 4 and 60 or more babies. If left in a community tank, the guppy fry will be quickly eaten if not secured in a breeding net or breeder's box. Sadly, even the guppy parents will partake in the baby guppy feast.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Please be responsible and have a plan for what to do with the guppy fry. If you're not interested in breeding them they should do just fine when kept as all males or all females. Mix the sexes and you will most likely have babies. If knowing that the larger fish in the tank are having a feast (as they would in the wild) on the baby guppies bothers you then only keep all males or all females. You may sometimes see some aggression amongst the males but nothing too out of hand.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Also, keep in mind that female guppies can be pregnant when you buy them from the store. Look for the gravid spot by the anal vent or a bulging in the belly area.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Albino Blue Topaz requires an aquarium of at least 10 gallons in size. It is a very peaceful fish and should be housed with tankmates of similar temperament. Though the Albino Blue Topaz is a hardy fish tolerant of small changes in water parameters, care should be taken to keep water temperature, pH, and nutrient levels in check. This hardy and energetic fish makes an excellent fish for beginning hobbyists.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Guppies are relatively easy to breed even for the beginning aquarists. If you are interested in breeding guppies, the ideal aquarium should have a covering of floating plants and a breeding box to protect the fry. Adults may eat the fry if left to fend for themselves without the breeding box. The fry should be fed brine shrimp, micro food, and pulverized flakes.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">The Albino Blue Topaz is an omnivore and requires both algae-based foods as well as meaty foods. An algae-based flake food, along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and brine shrimp will provide guppies with the proper nutrition.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Portion: 5x5cm</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Micranthemum</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Micranthemum ‘Monte Carlo” is a low growing aquatic plant that originates from New Zealand.  It is a perfect foreground plant that if given sufficient lighting and nutrients can grow into a thick carpet of green foliage.  The leaves are small and round with a beautiful bright green colouration that can nicely offset any neutral-toned substrate.  This plant is very similar to Hemianthus callitrichoides (HC/Dwarf Baby Tears) but the leaves are larger and in our experience, it's easier to grow.  When hobbyist are having trouble growing HC, we recommend giving Monte Carlo a try.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">High lighting and Co2 injection are necessary to keep this plant low growing.  Vertical growing thin stalks are an indication of lack of lighting while yellowing leaves can mean nutrition deficiency.  Thin leaves can also hint at a lack of Co2.  This plant can grow quickly and require regular trimming when kept under proper conditions. </p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">This plant can grow submerged or emersed in dry start aquariums and Wabi Kusa.  Because this plant is small with tiny roots, it can prove difficult to keep planted into the substrate.  In this case, a dry start can help by allowing time for the roots to anchor into the substrate before flooding the tank.</p>

<h3 data-mce-fragment=""1"">Characteristics of Aponogeton Madagascariensis</h3>
<p class=""gt-block"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">While the related species have a regular reticular structure, here they are irregular, giving rise to an interesting appearance, like A. madagascarensis, this aquatic plant is also native to Madagascar. TO <strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">temperatures</strong> permanent of <strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">20º to max. 24 ° C</strong> plants emerge even without dormancy.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">For healthy growth, a nutrient-rich substrate is required, so the supply of nutrients and iron over the water must also be ensured by regular fertilization. Good lighting thanks to Aponogeton madagascariensis with a compact wax.</p>
<p class=""gt-block"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">The elongated tubers of Aponogeton madagascariensis should be placed in a part of the soil. Plants already rooted in the area facilitate their own root formation. These should prefer semi-shady to shady places, such as Aponogeton madagascariensis with the formation of 1-2 leaves<strong data-mce-fragment=""1""> grows rapidly</strong> about it monthly. The wide, round and oval leaves can reach 20-50 cm long and other plants quickly take light. With a total height of 50 cm, care is only recommended in sufficiently large aquariums.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Adjust environmental conditions, the natural resting phase of Aponogeton madagascariensis. New leaves are then constantly being formed over several years. Often blooms in the aquarium. The white to yellow inflorescence sits on a stable stem and develops encapsulated fruits, the seeds of which first float to the surface of the water and then sink into the ground where they can take root. In well-bred rhizomes, propagation is also possible by dividing the rhizome, but the tubers should not be damaged.</p>
<p class=""gt-block"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Aponogeton madagascariensis, in addition to the nutrient-rich substrate, <strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">soft water</strong> and colder and regular water changes. The <strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">temperatures</strong> are ideally in the range of <strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">18º - 24 ° C</strong>. Warmer water has lower growth height and smaller leaves, but 25 ° C should not be permanently exceeded.

Aponogeton henkelianus, the large-leaved or even narrow-leaved lattice-leaf plant, is a grateful grower if you pay attention to it through frequent water changes and provide it with gentle, vigorous-moving water.

large-red-ozelot-sword,Large Red Ozelot Sword,"<h3 data-mce-fragment=""1"">Red Ozelot Sword is a fantastic beginner plant for those just getting into plants. Red Ozelot Sword grows at a decent pace, and it doesn't require any special lighting conditions. Of course, in higher light, the colors will really come out. However, even under low light, it will maintain some of its colorations.</h3>
<h3 data-mce-fragment=""1"">Just like other Swords, Red Ozelot Sword will do well in either a nutrient rich substrate or the use of root tabs to give it some nutrients at its roots.</h3>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Common Name: Downoi</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Downoi is a low growing aquatic plant originating from Thailand that has become popular in the past several years.  Its a midground plant that if given sufficient lighting and nutrients can grow into a thick bush of green foliage.  This plant has a unique appearance, with long and wavy leaves that almost resemble Buce Catherinae types.  It can grow both emersed and submerged.  </p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Downoi is not considered hard to grow as long as you have sufficient lighting. CO2 is not absolutely necessary to keep the plant alive but it does allow it to thrive. Side shoots will develop as the plant matures. Propagation is simple, just cut any side shoots or along the stem and replant</p>

When pruning is necessary, replant the upper portions and discard the bottom portions. For propagation, the plant can be encouraged to produce side shoots by cutting off upper portions and leaving the rooted, bottom portions in place. These stumps will produce one or more side shoots in a couple of days. Once they are several inches long, they can be removed and replanted in the substrate to create new plants.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""> <br data-mce-fragment=""1""> This red and orange hued species is an excellent choice for the smaller aquascape because of its small size and moderate growth rate.

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">Crypt Flamingo is one of our favorites here at the ASD' Rare Plant Farm.  The ruffled leaves and pink coloration really sets this plant apart from the other more common Crypts. This is extremely rare and sought after plant from collectors.  The exotic pink colors make it desirable compared to the common green or brown colored Cryptocoryne species. New leaves tend to have a blood red color initially which naturally lighten up into a pinkish tint over time.</p>
<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">It is generally a pretty easy plant to keep once it gets established in an aquarium. When grown under optimum conditions with high light and CO2, this plant can develop an intense pink coloration.  </p>

anubias-panda-very-rare-limited-stock,Anubias Panda- Very rare/limited stock.,"<p data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Anubias Panda, also known as Anubias White Panda is a variant of the commonly seen Anubias species. Its extremely unique coloring was derived from the normal green Anubias population through the use of very particular selection. It is rarer than Anubias White or Anubias Pinto. This specific variant of the Anubias plant is also slow growing but requires more light than its other Anubias counterparts in order to thrive. Similar in size to Anubias Nana Petite, Pinto makes for an uncommon but unique addition to any planted aquarium from nano tanks to larger standard sized tanks. Their interesting coloration provides a wonderful contrast and pop of color against darker aquascaping stones, aquarium driftwood and other aquatic plants.</span></p>

Its extremely unique coloring was derived from the normal green Anubias population through the use of very particular selection.

This specific variant of the Anubias plant is also slow growing but requires more light than its other Anubias counterparts in order to thrive. Similar in size to Anubias Nana Petite, Pinto makes for an uncommon but unique addition to any planted aquarium from nano tanks to larger standard sized tanks.

lindernia-rotundifolia,Lindernia Rotundifolia,"<p>Lindernia rotundifolia is a small amphibious plant from the tropics of Africa, Asia, Central and South America. In its terrestrial stage it grows prostrate and develops nice blue-white flowers, followed by small capsules with many seeds. Under water the stems grow upright with few branches. There is also a selection with whiteish nerves, labeled as Lindernia rotundifolia 'Variegated'.</p>
<p>As aquarium plant, Lindenia rotundifolia is not demanding, however it should be planted in a well-lit place. It grows relatively fast, and as well as other stem plants it is easily propagated by stem cuttings. It grows vigorously in emersed culture and also propagates by self-seeding.</p>
<p>With its quite small, roundish, freshly green leaves, quite long internodes and thin, upright stems, this Lindernia provides an interesting contrast to plants with different texture and coloration. It looks well as a group in the midground and is also suitable for nano tanks. In emersed setups such as paludaria and Wabi-Kusa, its small but conspicuous flowers are nice blue-white colour spots.</p>",Aquatic Swan Design,,Product_Plants,"",true,Title,Default Title,,,,,,,,"",0.0,shopify,deny,manual,8.99,,true,true,,,,,"",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0587/7422/5058/products/Linderniarotundifolia_Variegate.jpg?v=1631004607,1,"",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kg,,,active
