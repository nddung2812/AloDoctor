    "description": "<p>A Red Cherry Shrimp can be a great little freshwater shrimp to add to an aquarium. Their bright red color really adds beauty to a tank, especially one loaded with live green aquarium plants and black gravel or substrate. Cherry Shrimp or Neocaridina heteropoda, also known simply as Cherry Shrimp, are natives of Taiwan. But most available in stores today are bread in captivity as they can reproduce in fresh water. Red Cherry Shrimp are active and interesting to watch. Here is an HD video of a Red Cherry Shrimp feeding in a planted aquarium.</p>",

    "description": "<p> </p>\n<p> The genus-name Echinodorus comes from Greek 'echino' (bristle, prickle) and 'doros' (gift) and refers to the hedgehog-like seeds, the species-name quadricostatus means 'with four ribs' and refers to the seeds.</p>\n<p> Portion: 3-5 plants per bunch</p>\n<p>Synonyms: Echinodorus magdalensis, Echinodorus intermedius.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Family Alismataceae</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Common Name: chain sword</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Location: Central and South America</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Echinodorus quadricostatus is a little plant that is appropriate for smaller tanks or as a foreground plant in bigger ones. The plant is 10-15 cm (4-6”) tall. It has 1-2 cm (.39-.78”) wide bright green leaves. The leaves are narrow lancet-shaped. This plant has characteristic light-green leaves which form a good contrast to the darker aquarium plants. It is most beautiful when planted in groups. In good conditions it produces runners which spread over the bottom. Growth is more compact when planted in a pot or between stones or other objects. Very light leaves are a sign of a shortage of micro-nutrients. There is some confusion about the name of this plant, and it has been sold as Echinodorus bolivianus var. magdalenensis.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The plant can be very prolific in proper conditions and will grow in all types of water</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The species is known in three variants: var. quadricostatus, var. magdalensis and var. xinguensis (narrow leaf form). These are separated only by differences in the form of the leaves.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Light requirements: medium-very high</p>\n<p> Echinodorus quadricostatus</p>\n<p>Temperature: 20-28 °C (68-82°F)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hardness tolerance: very soft-hard</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>pH tolerance: 6-9</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Growth: fast</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Propagation: Very prolific. Sends out runners.</p>\n<p>  </p>\n<p>I got this plant for my upstairs 70 gallon display tank. This tank is a Fluval Osaka 260 tank. This is the tank with the rounded glass corners on the tank. This tank comes with 36\" T5 high output double fluorescent fixtures with 2 bulbs. The tank is filtered with a Fluval 405. There are many different plants in this set up. I was able to try some plants I normally stay away from since this tank has better lighting on it than I normally have over my planted tanks. I did have an algae bloom problem for several months after setting the tank up. This was the type of algae that floats through the water. I just slowly kept adding plants and eventually this bloom disappeared. This plant didn’t do much at the beginning when I got it. It put out 3 little plants and stopped there. It stayed like that for over 3 months. Then one day while doing a water change I noticed something different about the quadricostatus plant. One of the little plants that the original plant had put out was growing like mad. It put out a really decent runner with lots of daughter plants on it. This runner made it out of the ground and kept growing daughter plants all the way up to the surface of the tank. I would think that there is at least 12 plants on that one runner. The catfish in the tank (farlowellas – 2 different species), have left this plant alone. The dwarf cichlids (Apistogramma borellii and Mikrogeophagus altispinosa) like to swim through the leaves but otherwise ignore the plants. I don’t add any fertilizers to my water. They get whatever comes from feeding the fish.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The tank gets monthly water changes since it is lightly stocked. The Fluval gets cleaned out properly every 6-8 weeks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the part of the tank that this plant is in, it’s created a little thicket of Echinodorus quadricostatus plants. I think if you let it, this interesting little plant could make a carpet in the foreground of your tank. I will be offering up this plant shortly to interested parties.</p>\n<p> </p>",

    "description": "<p> </p>\n<p>With 'Tiger' and 'Red', two pretty new forms of Cryptocoryne spiralis have entered the market via ADA few years ago. They are still rarely available in Europe. The Spiral water trumpet from southwestern India is an extremely polymorphic species, however the form 'Tiger' is unique. It resembles Cryptocoryne albida \"Brown\" but gets larger and grows faster. Its submerged leaves are very narrowly lanceolate with smooth to wavy edge, brown-red with dark \"tiger stripes\" that are more pronounced than in Cryptocoryne spiralis 'Red'. It also differs from the latter by wider, shorter, more spreading leaves under same growth conditions. Sometimes the midrib is vividly green, but less often than in 'Red'. In our aquariums, the 'Tiger' has formed nearly 30 cm long, 1,3 cm wide leaves but may become considerably taller.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As several other Cryptocoryne spiralis forms, 'Tiger' is apparently a quite easy aquarium plant. Nutrient-rich substrate and CO2 addition are very beneficial for its growth. It is not a low-light plant, the lighting should be at least moderate, and strong light enhances its showy coloration. With time, daughter rosettes appear at the base of the plant that develops a tuft with many leaves and strong roots. The daughter plants can be cut off for propagation. We have not yet noticed long runners in C. spiralis 'Tiger'.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cryptocoryne spiralis 'Tiger' is an eye-catcher in not too small aquariums, best as a solitary bush in the midground. Its red-brown tones contrast well with light green plants</p>",

Smaller than the more commonly known, Anubias Nana Petite, Anubias Chili resembles Anubias Pangolino, another rare variant of Anubias. Anubias Chili has very small leaves that resemble small chili peppers and is very easy to care for in a planted aquarium. Like all Anubias plants, Anubias Chili is also very slow growing and does not require too much care to do well in a planted tank. </p>\n<p>Like other Anubias, this variant is a flowering plant that grows best when the rhizome is attached to a hard surface such as aquarium wood or stones. Anubias species have low to medium light requirements and can benefit from regular fertilization along with CO2 injection. While CO2 is not necessary, it can promote faster growth and more robust leaves. Since Anubias are slow growers, the leaves are susceptible to algae growth if placed under lighting that is too strong.  </p>\n<p>Propagation is easy and straightforward; simply cut or pull apart rhizomes to be replanted. <span>Make sure to keep the rhizomes above your substrate or the plant has the potential to rot.  </span></p>\n<p><b>Notes:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Anubias are strong plants that can thrive in a variety of environments.</span></li>\n<li>\n<span>These epiphytes can be planted above the substrate or attached to hardscape</span>.</li>\n<li>Burying the rhizome, will cause the plant to melt and die.</li>\n<li><span>Do not make drastic changes to the aquarium.

All cellophanes, like all bettas, do carry one of the three iridescent colors: Green, royal blue or steel blue. Meaning that if you were to flash your flashlight on them you would see traces of one of the three above colors, usually on body and at the base of fins. Because cellophanes do not show any pigment, you can oftentimes see through their body (to some degree) and can decipher eggs, spines etc... But I must state right away that cellophane bettas DO NOT look like \"glass fish\" (where you can see EVERYTHING!). They are primarily flesh colored and NOT transparent.</span></p>",

Though guppies are typically known for their vibrant coloration, the male Albino Blue Topaz features an exciting blue-orange coloration on the face, dorsal fin, and tail fin. This fresh, exciting coloration makes the Albino Blue Topaz stand out and is relished by guppy enthusiasts and any freshwater aquarium hobbyist interested in unusual and distinct fish.</span></div>\n<div class=\"quick_stat_entry\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The guppy (<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">poecilia reticulata) </em>is one of the most beautiful and easy to keep fish of all times.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">A great tropical fish for freshwater aquarium fish beginners, the Guppy is a very hardy tropical fish that is also a very prolific breeder. The male guppy is easy to distinguish from the female guppy because the male is usually more colorful with extremely colorful and large caudal fins (tails). The female is usually larger, thicker bodied, with less color and a smaller cuadal fin (tail).</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">They are livebearers which means that the babies are free swimming at birth. At each birth, the female can have anywhere between 4 and 60 or more babies. If left in a community tank, the guppy fry will be quickly eaten if not secured in a breeding net or breeder's box. Sadly, even the guppy parents will partake in the baby guppy feast.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Please be responsible and have a plan for what to do with the guppy fry. If you're not interested in breeding them they should do just fine when kept as all males or all females. Mix the sexes and you will most likely have babies. If knowing that the larger fish in the tank are having a feast (as they would in the wild) on the baby guppies bothers you then only keep all males or all females. You may sometimes see some aggression amongst the males but nothing too out of hand.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Also, keep in mind that female guppies can be pregnant when you buy them from the store. Look for the gravid spot by the anal vent or a bulging in the belly area.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Albino Blue Topaz requires an aquarium of at least 10 gallons in size. It is a very peaceful fish and should be housed with tankmates of similar temperament. Though the Albino Blue Topaz is a hardy fish tolerant of small changes in water parameters, care should be taken to keep water temperature, pH, and nutrient levels in check. This hardy and energetic fish makes an excellent fish for beginning hobbyists.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Guppies are relatively easy to breed even for the beginning aquarists. If you are interested in breeding guppies, the ideal aquarium should have a covering of floating plants and a breeding box to protect the fry. Adults may eat the fry if left to fend for themselves without the breeding box. The fry should be fed brine shrimp, micro food, and pulverized flakes.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Albino Blue Topaz is an omnivore and requires both algae-based foods as well as meaty foods.

    "description": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Information</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Albino Koi guppy (poecilia reticulata var Albino Koi) is one of the most beautiful and easy to keep fish of all time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The male Albino Koi Guppy features an exciting red-orange coloration on the face, dorsal fin, and tail fin. This fresh, exciting coloration makes the Albino Koi Guppy stand out and is relished by guppy enthusiasts and any freshwater aquarium hobbyist interested in unusual and distinct fish. All of our guppy strains are home bred and at least 3rd generation from imports. The Albino Koi Guppy is one of many unique varieties of the Poecilia reticulata guppy. These strains are all developed through years of careful, selective breeding. Guppies are typically known for their vibrant coloration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">A great tropical fish for freshwater aquarium fish beginners, the Albino Koi Guppy is a very hardy tropical fish that is also a very prolific breeder. The male Albino Koi guppy is easy to distinguish from the female Albino Koi guppy because the male is usually more colorful with extremely colorful and large caudal fins (tails). The female is usually larger, thicker bodied, with less color and a smaller cuadal fin (tail).</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Breeding</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppies are livebearers which means that the guppy fry are free swimming at birth. At each birth, the female Albino Koi guppy can have anywhere between 4 - 60+ fry. If left in a community tank, the Albino Koi guppy fry will be quickly eaten if not secured in a breeding net, breeder's box, or aquatic plants. Sadly, even the guppy parents will partake in the baby guppy feast.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Please be responsible and have a plan for what to do with the Albino Koi guppy fry. If you're not interested in breeding them they should do just fine when kept as all males or all females. Mix the sexes and you will most likely have babies. If knowing that the larger fish in the tank are having a feast (as they would in the wild) on the baby guppies bothers you then only keep all males or all females. You may sometimes see some aggression amongst the males but nothing too out of hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Also, keep in mind that female guppies can be pregnant when you buy them. Look for the gravid spot by the anal vent or a bulging in the belly area.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Tank Requirements</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Albino Koi guppy requires an aquarium of at least 10 gallons in size. It is a very peaceful fish and should be housed with tankmates of similar temperament. Though the Albino Koi guppy is a hardy fish tolerant of small changes in water parameters, care should be taken to keep water temperature, pH, and nutrient levels in check. This hardy and energetic fish makes an excellent fish for beginning hobbyists.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppies are relatively easy to breed even for the beginning aquarists. If you are interested in breeding guppies, the ideal aquarium should have a covering of floating plants and a breeding box to protect the fry. Adults may eat the fry if left to fend for themselves without the breeding box. The fry should be fed brine shrimp, micro food, and pulverized flakes.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Food</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Albino Koi guppy is an omnivore and requires both algae-based foods as well as meaty foods. An algae-based flake food, along with freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and brine shrimp will provide guppies with the proper nutrition.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Food</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Fancy Guppies will accept most fish food including vitamin enriched flakes, frozen, freeze-dried, and live foods. Try to give them a variety of foods for optimum health and coloration. Feeding them live or frozen foods every once in a while should do wonders for their activity levels and general well being.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Water Temperature</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppies are hardy and can withstand a wide temperature range from 66F - 84F (19C - 29C). However, these guppies will do best in a 72f-78f range and the temperature can be increased to facilitate breeding and increased growth speed.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Difficulty</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Guppies are good for freshwater beginners when you have only one sex. This fish will breed easily in your tank if you plan on keeping males and females in the same tank.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Guppy Temperament / Behavior</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This is a peaceful and hardy fish that is good for beginners.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Best Plants for Albino Koi Guppies</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We highly recommend pearl weed for its ability to provide cover and break line of sight. Pearl weed provides excellent cover for fry and their food in the form of biofilm as well. Taiwan lilies are a great addition to any tank with guppies. The guppies will use the leaves as hammocks and sleep in them at night. Really any aquatic plant that provides lots of cover and biofilm for fry will be a fantastic addition to your aquarium.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Suggested Albino Koi Guppy Tank Mates</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">We have had great success keeping our breeding guppies in community tanks with Corydoras, Neocaridina Shrimp, and Bristlenose Pleco.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Albino Koi Guppy Quick Care Guide</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Care Guide</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scientific Name: Poecilia reticulata var Albino Koi</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Common Names: Guppy, Fancy Tail Guppy, Millions Fish, Rainbow Fish</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Color: Red, Orange, White, Light-Yellow</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Guppy Care Level: Easy, good for freshwater beginners when you have only one sex.

New leaves are then constantly being formed over several years. Often blooms in the aquarium. The white to yellow inflorescence sits on a stable stem and develops encapsulated fruits, the seeds of which first float to the surface of the water and then sink into the ground where they can take root. In well-bred rhizomes, propagation is also possible by dividing the rhizome, but the tubers should not be damaged.</p>\n<p class=\"gt-block\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Aponogeton madagascariensis, in addition to the nutrient-rich substrate, <strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">soft water</strong> and colder and regular water changes.

This specific variant of the Anubias plant is also slow growing but requires more light than its other Anubias counterparts in order to thrive. Similar in size to Anubias Nana Petite, Pinto makes for an uncommon but unique addition to any planted aquarium from nano tanks to larger standard sized tanks. Their interesting coloration provides a wonderful contrast and pop of color against darker aquascaping stones, aquarium driftwood and other aquatic plants.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Portion: </strong><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This listing is for 1 plant with around 4-5 leaves.

Its extremely unique coloring was derived from the normal green Anubias population through the use of very particular selection. Each leaf slightly differs and the amount of the marbled effect present will vary. This specific variant of the Anubias plant is also slow growing but requires more light than its other Anubias counterparts in order to thrive. Similar in size to Anubias Nana Petite, Pinto makes for an uncommon but unique addition to any planted aquarium from nano tanks to larger standard sized tanks. Their interesting coloration provides a wonderful contrast and pop of color against darker aquascaping stones, aquarium driftwood and other aquatic plants.</span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong>Portion:</strong><br></span></p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This listing is for 1 plant with around 5+ leaves.

In its terrestrial stage it grows prostrate and develops nice blue-white flowers, followed by small capsules with many seeds. Under water the stems grow upright with few branches. There is also a selection with whiteish nerves, labeled as Lindernia rotundifolia 'Variegated'.</p>\n<p>As aquarium plant, Lindenia rotundifolia is not demanding, however it should be planted in a well-lit place. It grows relatively fast, and as well as other stem plants it is easily propagated by stem cuttings. It grows vigorously in emersed culture and also propagates by self-seeding.</p>\n<p>With its quite small, roundish, freshly green leaves, quite long internodes and thin, upright stems, this Lindernia provides an interesting contrast to plants with different texture and coloration. It looks well as a group in the midground and is also suitable for nano tanks. In emersed setups such as paludaria and Wabi-Kusa, its small but conspicuous flowers are nice blue-white colour spots.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Black Cherry Shrimps<strong> </strong>are great beginner aquarium shrimp and they have amazing colouration. They are one of the hardiest shrimp we keep in the shrimp room.<br><br>Black Cherry Shrimp is a colour variant of the Neocaridina davidi (formerly Neocaridina heteropoda) species. Little is known about how this variant came to be bred, but they are slowly gaining in popularity within the dwarf shrimp hobby due to their stunning colouration and ease of care. Their care requirements are very similar to Red Cherry Shrimp (the most popular type of dwarf shrimp in the aquarium hobby), and they are just as hardy and easy to breed.

Little is known about how this variant came to be bred, but they are slowly gaining in popularity within the dwarf shrimp hobby due to their stunning coloration and ease of care. Their care requirements are very similar to Red Cherry Shrimp (the most popular type of dwarf shrimp in the aquarium hobby), and they are just as hardy and easy to breed.

    "description": "<p><span>The Crystal Red Shrimp is a one of the most popular and coveted shrimp for the hobbyist, due to their bold, unique coloring and the challenge of raising them. Crystal Red Shrimp require very specific water parameters and near perfect water quality. They are ideally kept in a Crystal Red Shrimp-only tank because of their precise care needs. However, they are non-aggressive and active shrimp. These shrimp are not recommended for beginners, particularly because their high price point and difficult care requirements means that there is little room for mistakes. However, with a little experience under your belt these gorgeous shrimp are worth the extra effort.</span></p>\n<p>Care: Intermediate - Difficult</p>\n<p><span>Temperature Range:64-76 F</span></p>\n<p><span>pH: 6.0-7.5</span></p>\n<p><span>TDS: 100-200 ppm</span></p>\n<p><span>GH: 4 - 6 dGH</span></p>\n<p><span>KH: 0 - 2 dKH</span></p>\n<p><span>Life Span: 1 - 2 years</span></p>\n<p><span>Size: 0.75 - 1.25”</span></p>\n<p><span>Diet: Omnivore</span></p>\n<p><span>Habitat: Freshwater, Fully Aquatic</span></p>\n<p><span>Breeding: Easy</span></p>\n<p><span>Gestation Period: 30 Days</span></p>",
